# USGS-earthquake
Using Leaflet and USGS earthquake data to create a map that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The map is using live data from [United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). The map below includes earthquakes from the past 7 days that have a magnitude greater than or equal to 1.0.
