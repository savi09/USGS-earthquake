# USGS-earthquake
Using Leaflet and USGS earthquake data to create a map that plots all of the earthquakes from the data set based on their longitude and latitude. The map is using live data from [United States Geological Survey](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/geojson.php). The map below includes earthquakes from the past 7 days that have a magnitude greater than or equal to 1.0. Each marker accounts for an earthquake in the past 7 days. The size of the marker signifies the magnitude of the earthquake. The color of the marker signifies the depth of the earthquake. To determine the earthquake's location and time, click on the marker.
